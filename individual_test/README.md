# Files Description

This is where the original algorithm developed by George Chen is run and analyzed. The outputs used in the excel document are slightly different from the actual values obtained from running George's matlab analysis code. The intermediate steps to achieve the excel document outputs was lost due to poor documentation:

<dl>
  <dt>1. Run single file matlab test analysis [GC alg]</dt>
  <dd>Script: matlab/FeatureIdentification.m</dd>
  <dd>Output: docs/matlab_data.csv </dd>
</dl>

This algorithm was re-written in python, where the exact same results were achieved:

<dl>
  <dt>2. Run single file python test analysis [GC alg]</dt>
  <dd>Script: python/uprite_extract.py </dd>
  <dd>Output: docs/python_data.csv </dd>
</dl>
