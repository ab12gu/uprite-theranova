Need to find gravity vector

You can organize it from min -> max and then run chauvnet's algorithm... same way person on stack overflow did it...

worked!

RS saving file: TO/HS for now

HS_TO direct gc (close)

Accel_window (first):
- Present User with datestamp window in single shade
- Shade regions and have user pick window
- Have recommended windows in specific highlight (close to RS)
- Show window lengths in comparision to reference system
- Allow for user to rerun algorithm with varying the parameters

Gravity_window (second):
- Do the same thing

GC algorithm:
- Straight copy and run on all data
