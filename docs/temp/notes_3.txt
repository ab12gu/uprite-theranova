08/06/18 Meeting Notes

Check new data if outputting all parameters...
`:generalize HS/TO
-> run on on all datasets
-> achieve under 5% error

Remove all outliers (not working with alg, due to walking issues)
-> analyze outliers later (seperate algorithm)
-> show what failed and what passed with comparision to reference data

Methods of analysis:
-> GC's method of cutoff ranges (steady state + envolope barute)
-> New method of wavelet form

May need to offset both sides of data



Later -> noise reduction algorithm
-> allows filter optimization for isolating peaks and troughs

->keep git log of version changes
