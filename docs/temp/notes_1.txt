ONLY ISSUE (Big issue):
Gravity accel vector uses values at 0.1 Hz to 0.7Hz fcut values...
(basically means smaller than estimated gravity vector...

Data output matches!
2 steps left:
Second, re-write only necessary system paramters
Third, check if really the gravity vector made any difference
Fourth, get a rough analysis on all data (dank)

NO MORE FUCKING MATLAB :)




Code Updates:

lowpassfilter: (filter of 5 Hz) x/50 = 0.1
removed fsamp from line 16

tailbone anl.
lowpassfilter:
divided fcuts by 50 (Ny)
fcuts were [10 11] LINE 485

featureident.
divide fcuts by 50... Line 7


Notes:
Only incorrect lowpassfilter is first filter

tailbone analysis: 
The gravity accel vector (low passed data used as a gravity vector): was much smaller
than GC tested with.... 
GC's estimated LPF-G = estimated 5 or 10 hz... (couldn't tell which one)
GC's used LPF-G = 0.1 Hz with 0.7 stopband
----> much lower gravity vector therefore not much low pass filtering at all...

earth_filt['x'] used a 10 Hz filter (11 stopband)

angular_pos[2]['z'] used a 5 Hz filter (6 stopband)
